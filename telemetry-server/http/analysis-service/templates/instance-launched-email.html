Hi,<br>
We've launched an EC2 instance with access to telemetry published data, at your
request. As the instance powers up you can:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Monitor instance status,</li>
  <li>Find public DNS, and</li>
  <li>Terminate the instance,</li>
</ul>
here: {{ monitoring_url }}<br>
<br>
Please, be sure to kill your instance when you're done with it.
